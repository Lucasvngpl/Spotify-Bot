# Spotify-Bot
Discord bot that yields musical recommendations based on top tracks of preferred and related artists.
The user types in !Music-Recommendations and is prompted to name their preferred artist.
The bot then scans through the Spotify API for the top tracks in the US for that artist and suggests listening to them.
The bot then suggests checking out similar artists and asks the user if they want to create a playlist based on "similar" music, essentially just top tracks from related artists.
There is also a question-answering feature, following inputs from users such as  "What kind of music do you like?" to the bot which gives a randomized answer from a list of responses.
